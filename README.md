# Project-Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction

I am done this project as a Data Scientist Intern at Intellipaat Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

In this project, I am going to work on the "Restaurant revenue" dataset which contains 100 observations of restaurants with 8 attributes.

Problem Statement:- Create a machine learning model to predict revenue of the restaurant based on the features present in the dataset.

Tasks To Be Performed:- In this project, you have to predict the restaurant revenue based on the independent features using a machine learning algorithm of your own choice.
